          We noticed a gap — many students, even after years at VIPS,
          didn&apos;t know about the range of societies or when important events
          were happening. Cleit solves that by bringing&nbsp;
          <span className="font-medium text-indigo-600">
            all society information into one simple, accessible space.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          From upcoming events to audition details, eligibility, contact
          information, and more — everything is updated and organized so you
          never miss an opportunity to participate, connect, and grow.
        </p>

          Today, Cleit serves VIPS, but our vision is bigger — to create a
          nationwide network where college life feels&nbsp;
